# This file is the source of truth for icon requirements.
# Used by:
#   - script/fetch-icons (to download icons)
#   - pkg/octicons/octicons_test.go (to validate icons are embedded)
#   - pkg/github/toolset_icons_test.go (to validate toolset icons exist)
#
# Add new icons here when:
#   - Adding a new toolset with an icon
#   - Adding a new tool that needs a custom icon
#
# Format: one icon name per line (without -24.svg suffix)
# Lines starting with # are comments
# Empty lines are ignored
